## End Goal
To create an application that generates weekly summaries for people on the latest tech updates.

## Problem
It's important to learn about new innovations in tech, especially as someone in that industry. However, keeping up with the news is hard and we're too lazy to sift through various articles everyday to keep up with the latest tech innovations.
